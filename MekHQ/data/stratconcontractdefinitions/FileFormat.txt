Let's break it down.

alliedFacilityCount - Decimal. The number of allied facilities to seed for the entire contract, split somewhat evenly among the tracks. Numbers less than zero indicate that the number of allied facilities should be scaled to the number of contract required lances. Avoid setting this too high, as the player will be swamped with allied reinforcements.

briefing - a (preferably brief) text description of the contract.

contractTypeName - the name of the contract

hostileFacilityCount - Decimal. Exactly like alliedFacilityCount, except for hostile facilities. Avoid setting this too high, as the player will be swamped with hostile reinforcements.

scenarioOdds - a list of base odds that a scenario will occur a) for a require lance on monday, b) when a lance is deployed to a hex on a track that does not have an allied facility. Picked randomly from the list for each track.

deploymentTimes - a list of deployment times, in days, for when a force gets assigned to a scenario. Once assigned, a force (and any reinforcements, and, theoretically, in the future, any salvage) will not return for the specified number of days. Picked randomly from the list for each track. 

globalScenarioModifiers/globalScenarioModifier - a list of all scenario modifier file names to apply to any scenario in this contract. Use sparingly.

objectiveParameters - a list of objectives for the contract. Its child elements follow:

objectiveCount - Decimal. How much of this particular objective to generate. A number less than zero indicates that it's a scaling multiplier to the number of contract required lances. Avoid setting this too low or too high, as it will lead to boredom or craziness due to either nothing to do or way too much to do.

objectiveScenarios/objectiveScenario - a list of possible scenario file names pre-seeded for this particular objective, that need to be completed in order too meet this objective. Ignored AnyScenarioVictory objective type.

objectivescenarioModifiers/objectiveScenarioModifier - a list of scenario modifiers file names to be applied to objective scenarios. Note that for AnyScenarioVictory, these modifiers will be applied to *all* scenarios, and thus this should be used sparingly.


objectiveType - the class of objective. There are four types:
AnyScenarioVictory - victory in any scenario. 
SpecificScenarioVictory - victory in specific pre-seeded scenarios, from the list in objectiveScenarios.
FacilityDestruction - drops some hostile facilities on the map, which the player must seize control over/destroy.
AlliedFacilityControl - drops some allied facilities on the map, which the player must retain control over (it is possible to retake if they were captured).
