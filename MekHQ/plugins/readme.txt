To install a plugin simply put it in this folder and restart MekHQ. You can place them in subfolders
if you want to organize them. Any plugins that are not packaged in a JAR file or in JavaScript will
require a script engine to run. Placing the script engine (for example, jython or jruby) in this folder
will allow MekHQ to use plugins written in that language. See docs/plugins.txt for details on how to
write plugins.
